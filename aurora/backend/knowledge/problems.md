# Common Cannabis Growing Problems

## Nutrient Deficiencies

### Nitrogen Deficiency
**Symptoms:**
- Lower leaves turn pale green, then yellow
- Yellowing moves upward over time
- Leaves eventually drop off
- Slow, stunted growth
- Small, thin leaves

**Causes:**
- Underfeeding
- pH out of range (lockout)
- Root problems limiting uptake
- Heavy flowering demand

**Solutions:**
- Add nitrogen-rich fertilizer
- Check and adjust pH (6.0-6.5 soil)
- Increase feeding frequency
- Check root health

### Phosphorus Deficiency
**Symptoms:**
- Dark green leaves with purple/red stems
- Purple patches on leaf edges
- Lower leaves affected first
- Slow growth, small leaves
- Poor root development

**Causes:**
- Cold root zone (<60°F)
- pH too high (>7.0)
- Underfeeding
- Poor drainage

**Solutions:**
- Add bloom nutrients (high P)
- Warm root zone
- Lower pH to 6.0-6.5
- Check drainage

### Potassium Deficiency
**Symptoms:**
- Brown, burnt leaf edges and tips
- Yellowing between veins
- Weak stems
- Slow bud development
- Lower and older leaves first

**Causes:**
- Underfeeding
- pH imbalance
- Salt buildup blocking uptake
- Overwatering

**Solutions:**
- Add potassium (sulfate of potash)
- Flush medium, adjust pH
- Let soil dry between waterings
- Kelp meal for organic grows

### Calcium Deficiency
**Symptoms:**
- Brown spots on new growth
- Curled, distorted new leaves
- Weak stems
- Leaf tips hook downward
- Dead spots spreading

**Causes:**
- Low cal-mag in coco/hydro
- pH too low (<6.0)
- Excess potassium
- Reverse osmosis water without supplements

**Solutions:**
- Add cal-mag supplement
- Raise pH slightly
- Dolomite lime in soil
- Check for potassium excess

### Magnesium Deficiency
**Symptoms:**
- Yellowing between veins (interveinal chlorosis)
- Starts on older/lower leaves
- Green veins with yellow patches
- Leaves curl upward
- Brown spots in late stage

**Causes:**
- pH too low
- Excess calcium/potassium
- Underfeeding
- Cold root zone

**Solutions:**
- Epsom salts foliar spray (1 tsp/qt)
- Cal-mag supplement
- Adjust pH to 6.0-6.5
- Check nutrient ratios

## Nutrient Toxicity/Burn

### Nitrogen Toxicity
**Symptoms:**
- Very dark green, shiny leaves
- "Claw" - tips curling down
- Weak, flexible stems
- Delayed flowering
- Reduced yields

**Solutions:**
- Reduce nitrogen
- Flush with plain water
- Switch to bloom nutrients
- Allow runoff

### Nutrient Burn (General)
**Symptoms:**
- Brown, crispy leaf tips
- Yellow edges progressing inward
- Curling leaves
- Slow growth

**Solutions:**
- Reduce nutrient strength 25-50%
- Flush medium
- Use plain water for 1-2 waterings
- Check EC levels

## pH Problems

### Low pH (<5.5)
**Lockouts:** Calcium, magnesium, phosphorus
**Symptoms:** Multiple deficiencies appearing together
**Solutions:**
- Add pH Up (potassium hydroxide)
- Dolomite lime in soil
- Check runoff pH
- Flush with correct pH water

### High pH (>7.0)
**Lockouts:** Iron, manganese, zinc, copper
**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on new growth
**Solutions:**
- Add pH Down (phosphoric acid)
- Sulfur for soil
- Flush with correct pH water

## Watering Problems

### Overwatering
**Symptoms:**
- Droopy leaves (but not crispy)
- Slow growth
- Yellow lower leaves
- Fungus gnats
- Root rot smell

**Solutions:**
- Let soil dry completely
- Improve drainage
- Add perlite to soil
- Lift pots to check weight
- Use smaller pots

### Underwatering
**Symptoms:**
- Wilting, droopy leaves
- Dry, crispy leaves
- Light pot weight
- Rapid improvement after watering

**Solutions:**
- Water more frequently
- Water until 10-20% runoff
- Mulch to retain moisture
- Check for hydrophobic soil

## Environmental Stress

### Heat Stress (>86°F / 30°C)
**Symptoms:**
- Leaves cupping/canoeing upward
- Taco leaves
- Yellow edges on upper leaves
- Foxtailing in flower
- Bleached buds near light

**Solutions:**
- Increase airflow
- Air conditioning
- Raise lights higher
- Night-cycle watering
- CO2 supplementation (allows higher temps)

### Cold Stress (<60°F / 15°C)
**Symptoms:**
- Purple stems and leaves
- Slow growth
- Phosphorus deficiency symptoms
- Leaf curling

**Solutions:**
- Add heating
- Insulate floor/walls
- Raise lights for warmth
- Heat mats for seedlings

### Light Burn
**Symptoms:**
- Bleached, white tops
- Yellow upper leaves
- Burnt look on upper canopy
- Leaves stay green at bottom

**Solutions:**
- Raise lights
- Dim lights if possible
- Improve ventilation
- Use light meter (check PPFD)

## Pests

### Spider Mites
**Identification:**
- Tiny dots on leaf undersides
- Fine webbing between leaves
- Yellow speckles on leaves
- Rapid reproduction in heat

**Treatment:**
- Increase humidity
- Neem oil spray
- Insecticidal soap
- Spinosad products
- Predatory mites (prevention)

### Fungus Gnats
**Identification:**
- Small black flies at soil surface
- Larvae in soil eating roots
- Slow growth, wilting

**Treatment:**
- Let soil dry out
- Yellow sticky traps
- BTi (Mosquito Bits)
- Beneficial nematodes
- Sand/perlite top layer

- Pyrethrin (last resort)

## Diseases

### Powdery Mildew

- VPD above 1.0 kPa
- Good air circulation
- Don't crowd plants
- Remove affected leaves

- Milk spray (40% milk, 60% water)
- Remove heavily affected plants

### Bud Rot (Botrytis)
**Identification:**
- Gray/brown mold in dense buds
- Yellow/brown leaves inside bud
- Easily pulls out
- Dense buds most susceptible

**Prevention:**
- Humidity below 50% in flower
- Defoliate for airflow
- Don't let buds touch
- Check large colas daily

**Treatment:**
- Remove all affected buds + surrounding
- Lower humidity immediately
- Increase airflow
- Harvest soon if spreading

### Root Rot (Pythium)

- May not recover if severe

## Training Damage

### Topping Stress
**Recovery time:** 2-5 days
**Issues:** Slowed growth, temporary wilting
**Solution:** Wait for recovery before more training

### HST (High Stress Training)
**Broken branches:**
- Tape immediately
- Support with stake
- Often heals in 1-2 weeks
- Knuckles form stronger

### LST Done Too Late
**Issues:** Snapping, slow recovery
**Solution:** Train earlier (week 3-4), bend gradually

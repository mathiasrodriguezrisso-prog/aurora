# Cannabis Nutrition Guide

## Macronutrients (NPK)

### Nitrogen (N)
Nitrogen is essential for vegetative growth, chlorophyll production, and protein synthesis.

**Deficiency Signs:**
- Yellowing of older/lower leaves (chlorosis)
- Stunted growth
- Pale green coloration overall
- Leaves falling off prematurely

**Excess Signs:**
- Very dark green leaves
- "Claw" shaped leaves curling down
- Delayed flowering
- Soft, weak stems

**Optimal Levels by Phase:**
- Seedling: Low (N-P-K ratio ~2-1-2)
- Vegetative: High (N-P-K ratio ~3-1-2)
- Early Flower: Medium (N-P-K ratio ~2-2-3)
- Late Flower: Low (N-P-K ratio ~1-3-4)

### Phosphorus (P)
Phosphorus is crucial for root development, energy transfer, and flower production.

**Deficiency Signs:**
- Purple/red stems and leaf stalks
- Dark green leaves with purple/bronze patches
- Slow growth and small leaves
- Poor root development

**Excess Signs:**
- Lockout of zinc, iron, and calcium
- Leaf tips and margins brown and crispy

**Optimal Levels by Phase:**
- Seedling: Low
- Vegetative: Low-Medium
- Flowering: High (critical for bud development)

### Potassium (K)
Potassium regulates water uptake, enzyme activation, and disease resistance.

**Deficiency Signs:**
- Brown, burnt leaf edges and tips
- Yellowing between leaf veins
- Weak stems and branches
- Slow bud development

**Excess Signs:**
- Calcium and magnesium lockout
- Salt buildup in medium

## Secondary Nutrients

### Calcium (Ca)
- Essential for cell wall structure
- Required for new growth
- Deficiency: Brown spots, curled new growth
- Sources: Dolomite lime, cal-mag supplements

### Magnesium (Mg)
- Central atom in chlorophyll
- Deficiency: Interveinal yellowing on older leaves
- Sources: Epsom salts, cal-mag supplements

### Sulfur (S)
- Component of proteins and vitamins
- Deficiency: Light green/yellow new growth
- Usually adequate in most nutrient lines

## Micronutrients

### Iron (Fe)
- Critical for chlorophyll synthesis
- Deficiency: Interveinal chlorosis on new leaves
- Solution: Lower pH, add chelated iron

### Manganese (Mn)
- Activates enzymes in photosynthesis
- Deficiency: Tan/gray spots on leaves

### Zinc (Zn)
- Required for growth hormones
- Deficiency: Twisted, stunted new leaves

### Boron (B)
- Cell wall formation, calcium transport
- Deficiency: Hollow stems, distorted growth

### Copper (Cu)
- Enzyme function
- Deficiency: Wilting, necrotic leaf tips

### Molybdenum (Mo)
- Nitrogen metabolism
- Deficiency: Marginal leaf scorch

## EC/PPM Guidelines

| Growth Stage | EC (mS/cm) | PPM (500 scale) |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Clones/Seedlings | 0.4-0.8 | 200-400 |
| Early Veg | 0.8-1.2 | 400-600 |
| Late Veg | 1.2-1.6 | 600-800 |
| Transition | 1.4-1.8 | 700-900 |
| Early Flower | 1.6-2.0 | 800-1000 |
| Mid Flower | 1.8-2.2 | 900-1100 |
| Late Flower | 1.4-1.8 | 700-900 |
| Flush | 0.0-0.4 | 0-200 |

## pH Guidelines

| Medium | Optimal pH Range |
|--------|-----------------|
| Soil | 6.0 - 6.8 |
| Coco Coir | 5.8 - 6.2 |
| Hydroponics | 5.5 - 6.0 |
| Aeroponics | 5.5 - 6.0 |

## Feeding Schedules

### Soil Growing
- Feed every 2-3 waterings
- Allow soil to dry between waterings
- Start at 25% recommended strength
- Increase gradually to 75-100%

### Coco Coir
- Feed with every watering
- Never let coco dry out completely
- Maintain 10-20% runoff
- Cal-mag supplement required

### Hydroponics
- Constant feeding through reservoir
- Change reservoir weekly
- Monitor pH and EC daily
- Top off with plain pH'd water

## Organic vs Synthetic

### Organic Nutrients
- Slower release
- Build soil biology
- More forgiving of errors
- Better flavor (subjective)
- Lower yields typically

### Synthetic Nutrients
- Immediately available
- Precise control
- Higher yields
- Less forgiving
- Requires proper flushing

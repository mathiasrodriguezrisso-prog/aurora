# Cannabis Growth Phases Guide

## 1. Germination (3-10 days)

### Overview
The germination phase is when seeds break dormancy and sprout their first root (taproot).

### Methods

**Paper Towel Method:**
1. Moisten paper towels (not dripping)
2. Place seeds between layers
3. Store in dark, warm location (75-85°F / 24-29°C)
4. Check daily, keep moist
5. Transplant when taproot is 0.5-1 inch

**Direct Soil Method:**
1. Pre-moisten soil
2. Plant seed 0.5 inch deep
3. Light covering of soil
4. Keep warm and humid
5. Seedling emerges in 3-7 days

**Water Soak Method:**
1. Soak seeds in room temp water
2. Maximum 24-32 hours
3. Transfer to paper towel or soil
4. Good for old seeds with hard shells

### Environment
- Temperature: 75-85°F (24-29°C)
- Humidity: 70-90%
- Light: Dark until sprout emerges
- No nutrients needed

### Success Tips
- Use bottled/filtered water
- Never let seeds dry out
- Don't overhandle once taproot emerges
- Plant taproot down when transplanting

## 2. Seedling Stage (2-3 weeks)

### Overview
Seedlings develop their first true leaves (serrated) after the initial round cotyledon leaves.

### Development Milestones
- Days 1-3: Cotyledons emerge and open
- Days 4-7: First true leaves appear (single blade)
- Days 8-14: Second set with 3 blades
- Days 15-21: Third set with 5 blades

### Environment
- Temperature: 68-77°F (20-25°C)
- Humidity: 65-75%
- Light: 18-24 hours (low intensity)
- Light distance: 24-30 inches (LED)

### Nutrient Requirements
- EC: 0.4-0.8 mS/cm
- pH: 6.0-6.5 (soil) / 5.8-6.0 (hydro)
- Start nutrients at 1/4 strength
- Focus: Mild and balanced

### Common Problems
- Stretching: Light too far or too weak
- Damping off: Overwatering, poor drainage
- Nutrient burn: Too much too soon
- Yellow leaves: pH issues or overwatering

## 3. Vegetative Stage (3-8 weeks)

### Overview
The plant focuses on building structure - stems, branches, and leaves for future bud production.

### Training Techniques

**Low Stress Training (LST):**
- Bend and tie branches outward
- Creates even canopy
- Multiple main colas
- Start week 3-4 of veg

**Topping:**
- Remove main growth tip
- Plant develops 2 main colas
- Wait until 4-6 nodes
- Recovery time: 2-3 days

**FIMing:**
- Remove 75% of main growth tip
- Creates 4+ main colas
- Less stress than topping

**Mainlining/Manifolding:**
- Systematic topping
- Creates 8-16 equal colas
- Requires longer veg time

### Environment
- Temperature: 70-85°F (21-29°C)
- Humidity: 50-70%
- Light: 18/6 or 20/4 schedule
- VPD: 0.8-1.2 kPa

### Nutrient Requirements
- EC: 1.0-1.6 mS/cm
- pH: 5.8-6.5
- High nitrogen focus
- Cal-mag important in coco/hydro

### When to Flip to Flower
- After desired size (plants double in flower)
- When canopy is even
- After training recovery
- Typically 4-8 weeks from seed

## 4. Flowering Stage (8-12 weeks)

### Overview
The reproductive phase where buds develop. Triggered by 12/12 light schedule (photoperiods) or automatically (autoflowers).

### Sub-Phases

**Transition/Stretch (Weeks 1-3):**
- Rapid vertical growth (stretch)
- Plants can double in height
- First pistils (white hairs) appear
- Continue some nitrogen

**Early Flower (Weeks 3-5):**
- Stretch slows
- Bud sites develop
- Increase P-K nutrients
- Reduce nitrogen gradually

**Mid Flower (Weeks 5-7):**
- Buds fattening
- Trichomes developing
- Aroma intensifying
- Peak nutrient demand

**Late Flower (Weeks 7-10+):**
- Buds ripening
- Trichomes cloudy/amber
- Pistils orange/brown
- Begin flush last 1-2 weeks

### Environment
- Temperature: 65-80°F (18-26°C)
- Humidity: 40-50%
- Light: 12/12 strict schedule
- VPD: 1.0-1.5 kPa

### Nutrient Requirements
- EC: 1.4-2.0 mS/cm
- pH: 5.8-6.5
- High P-K ratio
- Reduce nitrogen

### Harvest Timing
Check trichomes with magnification:
- Clear: Too early, low potency
- Mostly cloudy: Peak THC, energetic effect
- 10-30% amber: Balanced effect
- 50%+ amber: Sedative effect

## 5. Harvest

### Pre-Harvest Preparation
- Flush 1-2 weeks before harvest
- Lower humidity to 40%
- Optional: 24-48 hours darkness
- Prepare drying space

### Harvesting Process
1. Cut whole plant or branches
2. Remove large fan leaves
3. Hang upside down to dry
4. Temperature control critical

### Wet Trimming vs Dry Trimming
**Wet Trim:** Easier, faster drying, less terpenes
**Dry Trim:** Better flavor, slower, more work

## 6. Drying (7-14 days)

### Environment
- Temperature: 60-70°F (15-21°C)
- Humidity: 55-65%
- Air circulation (not direct on buds)
- Complete darkness

### Process
- Hang whole plants or branches
- Check daily for mold
- Ready when small stems snap (not bend)
- Large stems should still bend slightly

### Common Mistakes
- Drying too fast (>3 days)
- Too much heat
- Direct fan on buds
- Not checking for mold

## 7. Curing (2-8 weeks minimum)

### Overview
Curing breaks down chlorophyll and improves flavor, smoothness, and potency.

### Process
1. Trim buds from stems
2. Place in airtight jars (3/4 full)
3. Store in cool, dark place
4. "Burp" jars daily (weeks 1-2)
5. Burp weekly after week 2

### Humidity Control
- Target: 58-62% RH in jars
- Use Boveda/Integra packs if needed
- If too wet: Leave lid off briefly
- If too dry: Add Boveda pack

### Duration
- Minimum: 2 weeks
- Good: 4-6 weeks
- Optimal: 8+ weeks
- Some strains improve for 6+ months

## Autoflower-Specific Guidelines

### Key Differences
- No light cycle change needed
- Faster total cycle (8-12 weeks)
- Cannot be cloned effectively
- Limited training time

### Recommended Schedule
- Light: 18-24 hours entire life
- Training: Start LST week 2-3 only
- No topping/high stress recommended
- Begin bloom nutrients at first pistils

### Timeline
- Weeks 1-2: Seedling
- Weeks 3-4: Early veg
- Weeks 5-6: Pre-flower/stretch
- Weeks 7-10: Flower
- Weeks 10-12: Ripen/harvest

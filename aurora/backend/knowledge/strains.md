# Cannabis Strains Guide

## Understanding Strain Types

### Indica
**Origin:** Hindu Kush mountain region (Afghanistan, Pakistan, India)

**Plant Characteristics:**
- Short, bushy plants (2-4 feet)
- Wide, dark green leaves
- Dense, heavy buds
- Shorter flowering time (8-9 weeks)
- Higher yields in smaller spaces

**Effects:**
- Body-focused relaxation
- Sedating, "couch-lock"
- Pain relief
- Sleep aid
- Appetite stimulation

**Growing Notes:**
- More resistant to cold
- Better for indoor grows
- Can handle heavier feeding
- Good for SOG (Sea of Green)

### Sativa
**Origin:** Equatorial regions (Thailand, Mexico, Colombia, Africa)

**Plant Characteristics:**
- Tall, lanky plants (5-15 feet)
- Thin, light green leaves
- Airy, elongated buds
- Longer flowering time (10-14 weeks)
- Heavy stretch in flower

**Effects:**
- Cerebral, uplifting
- Energizing
- Creative stimulation
- Focus enhancement
- May increase anxiety in some

**Growing Notes:**
- Needs more vertical space
- Training essential for indoors
- Lighter feeding often
- Better outdoors in warm climates

### Hybrid
**Overview:**
Modern strains are mostly hybrids, combining indica and sativa genetics.

**Types:**
- Indica-dominant: 70/30, 60/40
- Sativa-dominant: 70/30, 60/40
- Balanced: 50/50

**Benefits:**
- Best traits from both parents
- More versatile growing
- Tailored effects possible
- Often more vigorous

### Ruderalis (Autoflower Base)
**Origin:** Russia, Central Asia

**Characteristics:**
- Very short (1-2 feet in pure form)
- Flowers automatically by age
- Highly resilient
- Lower THC (in pure form)
- Crossed with indica/sativa for autos

## Autoflowers vs Photoperiods

### Autoflowering Strains

**Advantages:**
- Flower automatically (no light change)
- Fast seed-to-harvest (8-12 weeks)
- Multiple harvests per season outdoors
- Smaller, stealthier plants
- Resilient and beginner-friendly

**Disadvantages:**
- Generally lower yields
- Cannot be cloned effectively
- Limited training time
- Cannot extend veg for larger plants
- May have slightly lower potency

**Light Schedule:**
- 18/6 or 20/4 entire life
- Some growers use 24/0
- No dark period requirement

### Photoperiod Strains

**Advantages:**
- Higher yield potential
- Can be cloned indefinitely
- Longer veg = bigger plants
- More training options
- Often higher potency
- Full size bud development

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires 12/12 flip
- Longer total grow time
- More light-sensitive
- Light leaks cause issues
- Schedule management needed
